this will hold the todo list of everything to get done for the models
Need to separate data that will go into the database and what we need to be on the frontend
The reason being I don't want to have a bunch of stuff going into the database less is more



// Database
-- just enough information to preserver relationshiops between entities
-- can build the items the user needs when needed 
	-- those can be thrown in view model or some type of entity for the user to see and manipulate
